# Notion Template

## 🔍 Content

This is the exact Second Brain system I use every day.

- **Inbox**:
    - The list of notes and tasks to take care of. For example, when we create a note, it has a `State` set to `To be reviewed`. Once we’re happy with its state, we should change it to `Reviewed`, which will remove it from your Inbox. You may decide to refine this view based on when you believe a note or a task to be ready.
- **Tasks**:
    - A list of tasks.
    - A task has a `Someday` field (Checkbox type) to express whether it should be done now or someday.
    - Each task has an optional due date and should be associated to domains (areas or resources) or projects.
- **Notes**:
    - A piece of content, interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from life experience, and stored in a secure place.
    - Each note should be associated to domains (areas or resources) or projects.
- **Mistake**:
    - A special kind of note (`Type` = `Mistake`) if you want to track your own [mistake journal](https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/mistake-journal).
    - Mistakes can be visualized in Notes in the Mistake journal view.
- **Kaizen**:
    - A curated list to help you grow.
    - My recommendation is to use the [*Save to Notion*](https://www.savetonotion.so/) extension as a read-later app to quickly mark interesting resources. Here’s [how](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teivah/thecodercafe/refs/heads/main/res/second-brain-save-to-notion.png) I configured it.
    - Kaizen resources are created as notes with `State` set to `Not started`.
    - Once the resource has been processed, you should set State to `In progress`, which will move the note in your Inbox.
    - ⚠️ Kaizen resources are created as notes, not tasks. Otherwise, summarizing an interesting resource (e.g., a blog post) would mean creating a Kaizen task + creating a related note. To avoid creating two pages, Kaizen resources are just notes and notes have a lifecycle.
- **Projects**: A list of projects (optional deadline and clear outcome; e.g., publishing a blog post).
- **Domains**:
    - Either an Area or a Resource.
    - **Areas**:
        - Ongoing responsibilities, what you’re committed to and require constant attention.
        - 💡 Areas can be organized hierarchically.
        - 💡 I recommend you setting a cover page to areas. Indeed, creating a new area uses the `New area` template which displays the sub-areas based on their cover page ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teivah/thecodercafe/refs/heads/main/res/second-brain-area.png)).
    - **Resources**:
        - A catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area.
        - 💡 Resources can be organized hierarchically.
- **Thought journal**: Used to track your raw ideas, which is ≠ from curated notes.
- **Feed**: Latest reviewed notes.
- **Archives**: Outdates resources.
