# Second Brain

Hello! I'm [Teiva Harsanyi](https://teivah.dev), a **software engineer at Google**. I'm the author of [100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58571862-100-go-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them) and the creator of [The Coder Cafe](https://thecoder.cafe) newsletter.

For over a decade, I failed miserably at keeping **an effective note-taking system**, mostly for two reasons:

1. I never had a single, centralized place. I used to rely on a combination of Notion + Apple Notes + a physical notebook + Kindle highlights + Anki.

1. I didn‚Äôt have a system that was generic enough. I had a different format pretty much every time: book summaries, posts, computer science notes, mistake journal, personal growth notes, and so on.

The result was a messy system that didn‚Äôt scale. I kept losing knowledge, and it made learning inefficient. When we read or watch a great resource but don‚Äôt capture what we learned from it, chances are high that within a few months or even weeks, that knowledge fades away. That‚Äôs what kept happening to me.

Then I discovered the [*Second Brain*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain) method. **It changed everything**.

## ‚ùì What is a Second Brain?

Our brain isn‚Äôt built to remember everything.  It‚Äôs great at thinking, solving, reacting but it forgets what we don‚Äôt actively use. That‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs how it stays efficient. The problem is: we‚Äôre constantly learning. Reading. Watching. Thinking.  And unless we capture that knowledge, most of it fades away.

**A Second Brain gives us a place to store it.  Not just to collect but to reuse, remix, and build on what we've already learned.**

For me, the breakthrough was to stop chasing the perfect note. I used to spend hours formatting, tagging, organizing‚Ä¶ and never looked at those notes again. Now, I focus on creating a system that‚Äôs simple, imperfect, but useful.  Something that actually helps me day to day‚Äîat work, while learning, and in my personal life.

It‚Äôs not about having a beautiful archive.  It‚Äôs about building something that supports how we think.

## ü§î Mindset

Knowledge work is about taking information and turning it into results, for example, delivering on a project. All day, we consume and then produce:

The problem with this approach is that most of the information that we will gain will eventually be lost. Sure, we might remember the most important parts for a while. But what about the rest? It will fade, eventually.

**What we miss is a feedback loop, a way to recycle information into knowledge that we can reuse later:**

That‚Äôs what a second brain gives us: a way to turn information into assets we can reinvest in the future.

## üß© Notes as Building Blocks

Another interesting idea is to stop seeing notes as a flat list of things we‚Äôve saved. Our notes can become building blocks, meaning pieces that help us create new ideas later on.

That‚Äôs a powerful shift: notes aren‚Äôt just storage, **they‚Äôre raw material for thinking**. They can connect and evolve into new ideas. Being able to track down all your notes in a single place makes those connections easier to spot and build on.

## üóíÔ∏è What's a Note?

So, what‚Äôs a note?

> A piece of content, interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from life experience, and stored in a secure place.

Let‚Äôs go over the different parts of that definition.

First, a note is **something to use, not just to collect**. Again, we‚Äôre not building an encyclopaedia, we‚Äôre building something that works for us. For example, if we‚Äôre interested in public speaking, we don‚Äôt need a note on every single resource we read or watch.

Instead, we should be asking a few questions to decide what‚Äôs worth capturing:

- Does it inspire us?

- Is it useful?

- Is this personal?

- Is it surprising?

Ultimately, we should capture what **resonates**.

For example, we may have read this amazing book that everyone is talking about and discover that it doesn‚Äôt resonate with us at all. Conversely, we may have watched a 30-second video that had a profound effect on us and triggered emotions. In this case, it‚Äôs better to spend some time creating a note on this video rather than the book.

When something resonates with us, it‚Äôs our emotion-based, intuitive mind telling us it‚Äôs interesting before our logical mind can explain why.

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Take Notes

Every time we take a note, we should ask: ‚Äú_How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?_‚Äù

One way to do that is to be mindful of our future limited time. Instead of tracking dozens, if not hundreds, of lines, we should focus on finding the essence, meaning the heart and soul of what a resource is trying to communicate.

But in some cases, that‚Äôs barely possible. For example, I recently read the F1: A distributed SQL database that scales whitepaper. How can we capture the essence of such a dense technical document containing so much valuable information?

The solution, brought again by the author, is to use the progressive summarization technique. In short, it‚Äôs about layering our notes:

- **Layer 1 - Captured notes**: Either a copy and paste or even better writing, down in our own words what we understood from it.

- **Layer 2 - Bolded passages**: Go over the captured notes and mark in bold the most important pieces.

- **Layer 3 - Highlighted passages**: Go over the bolded passages and highlight the most important pieces.

- **Layer 4 - Summary**: Write down a summary.

## üóÇÔ∏è PARA

The PARA system is at the core of the method. It is designed for actionability, with layers of action. To make things clear, a note can be assigned to one of the following domains:

- **Project**: A short-term effort with a possible due date and a clear outcome that needs to happen in order to mark the project as complete. For example, publish a blog post about second brain.

- **Area**: Ongoing responsibilities, what we are committed to, and what requires constant attention.

- **Resource**: A catchall for anything that doesn‚Äôt belong to a project or an area.

- **Archive**: When a note becomes inactive or outdated, we can move it to the archive.

The PARA system has two main benefits.

- **Clear focus**: We‚Äôre not mixing short-term efforts with long-term maintenance. It helps us focus on outcomes and next steps rather than just piles of information.

- **Genericity**: PARA can handle all kinds of notes. It organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.

As I said, I used to lack a system that was generic enough to track all my notes. Now, whether it‚Äôs a book I read, a course I followed, or a post I came across, I capture everything that resonates with me using the PARA system.
